This repository contains solutions of common algorithmic problems in different programming languages.

Feel free to comment on commits to discuss the solutions. PRs are also welcome.

# Guidelines

* Every problem has to be in a separate file
* The problem has to be described in a comment block before the solution
* Ideally, every solution has to be sent as a single commit
* Commit messages have to be in the following format: `[Language] Add|Improve "Problem Name" solution`. E.g: `[JS] Add "Two Sum" solution`
